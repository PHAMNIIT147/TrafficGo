### About the project
The purpose of this project is to create a software system to monitor the speed of vehicles on the road and detect cases exceeding the speed limit, impose penalties according to the laws of the host country, help improve security. safe and minimize traffic accidents with the use of deep learning models in the system.

This project has been built using the [PyQt5](https://www.qt.io/design?utm_campaign=Navigation%202019&utm_source=Nav%202019) framework, which allows to build an app for mobile, desktop & web from a single codebase.
